     8. t=10:30: Patient 18 chosen over Patient 20: higher severity (level 5 vs 1), deteriorating faster (0.28 vs 0.14 rate), much longer wait (105min vs 30min) (margin: +0.034, confidence: low)
     9. t=11:15: Patient 21 chosen over Patient 22: higher severity (level 5 vs 4), deteriorating faster (0.63 vs 0.24 rate), longer wait (30min vs 15min) (margin: +0.277, confidence: high)
     10. t=12:00: Patient 22 chosen over Patient 8: deteriorating faster (0.24 vs 0.13 rate) (margin: +0.026, confidence: low)
     11. t=12:15: Patient 8 chosen over Patient 19: higher severity (level 5 vs 3), much longer wait (435min vs 180min) (margin: +0.031, confidence: low)
     12. t=14:30: Patient 24 chosen over Patient 25: higher severity (level 5 vs 4), longer wait (75min vs 60min) (margin: +0.137, confidence: high)
