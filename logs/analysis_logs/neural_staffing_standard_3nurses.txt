     13. t=20:15: Patient 27 chosen over Patient 26: close call: severity edge to Patient 27 (4 vs 5), wait time edge to Patient 26, deterioration edge to Patient 26, treatment speed edge to Patient 27 (margin: +0.012, confidence: low)
     14. t=21:30: Patient 26 chosen over Patient 5: deteriorating faster (0.28 vs 0.13 rate) (margin: +0.013, confidence: low)
     15. t=22:15: Patient 5 chosen over Patient 25: much longer wait (1095min vs 525min) (margin: +0.001, confidence: low)
     16. t=22:30: Patient 25 chosen over Patient 17: close call: same severity (level 5), wait time edge to Patient 17, similar deterioration rates (~0.12), treatment speed edge to Patient 25 (margin: +0.002, confidence: low)
     17. t=23:45: Patient 28 chosen over Patient 29: higher severity (level 5 vs 4), deteriorating faster (0.62 vs 0.25 rate), longer wait (105min vs 75min) (margin: +0.014, confidence: low)
