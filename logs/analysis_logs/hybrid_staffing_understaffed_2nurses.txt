     9. t=15:15: Patient 32 chosen over Patient 28: close call: same severity (level 5), wait time edge to Patient 28, similar deterioration rates (~0.69), treatment speed edge to Patient 32 (margin: +0.052, confidence: moderate)
     10. t=18:00: Patient 28 chosen over Patient 5: higher severity (level 5 vs 2), deteriorating faster (0.67 vs 0.07 rate) (margin: +0.001, confidence: low)
     11. t=18:45: Patient 5 chosen over Patient 35: much longer wait (960min vs 15min) (margin: +0.000, confidence: low)
     12. t=19:30: Patient 37 chosen over Patient 35: close call: same severity (level 5), wait time edge to Patient 35, similar deterioration rates (~0.29), treatment speed edge to Patient 37 (margin: +0.030, confidence: low)
     13. t=21:00: Patient 39 chosen over Patient 35: deteriorating faster (0.66 vs 0.29 rate) (margin: +0.117, confidence: high)
     14. t=22:45: Patient 40 chosen over Patient 38: deteriorating faster (0.29 vs 0.04 rate) (margin: +0.126, confidence: high)
     15. t=23:00: Patient 38 chosen over Patient 35: close call: same severity (level 5), wait time edge to Patient 35, deterioration edge to Patient 35, treatment speed edge to Patient 38 (margin: +0.025, confidence: low)

AGGREGATE STATISTICS:
   Mean patients treated: 16.5 +/- 1.1
   Mean weighted wait: 182.12 +/- 23.99 hours
