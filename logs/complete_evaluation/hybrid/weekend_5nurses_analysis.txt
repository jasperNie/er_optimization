     7. t=20:15: Patient 27 chosen over Patient 26: deteriorating faster (0.29 vs 0.17 rate) (margin: +0.053, confidence: moderate)
     8. t=21:00: Patient 28 chosen over Patient 26: close call: same severity (level 3), wait time edge to Patient 26, similar deterioration rates (~0.17), similar treatment times (~150min) (margin: +0.016, confidence: low)
     9. t=23:00: Patient 30 chosen over Patient 29: close call: same severity (level 5), wait time edge to Patient 29, similar deterioration rates (~0.13), similar treatment times (~195min) (margin: +0.034, confidence: low)
     10. t=23:30: Patient 34 chosen over Patient 29: deteriorating faster (0.60 vs 0.11 rate) (margin: +0.073, confidence: moderate)
     11. t=24:00: Patient 35 chosen over Patient 36: deteriorating faster (0.52 vs 0.30 rate), longer wait (30min vs 15min) (margin: +0.002, confidence: low)
