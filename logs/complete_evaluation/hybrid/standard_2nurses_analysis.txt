   ALL TRIAGE DECISIONS:
     1. t=04:45: Patient 5 chosen over Patient 4: close call: same severity (level 5), wait time edge to Patient 4, similar deterioration rates (~0.69), similar treatment times (~255min) (margin: +0.005, confidence: low)
     2. t=05:30: Patient 4 chosen over Patient 7: much longer wait (180min vs 105min) (margin: +0.006, confidence: low)
     3. t=06:00: Patient 7 chosen over Patient 11: much longer wait (135min vs 30min) (margin: +0.003, confidence: low)
     4. t=09:00: Patient 14 chosen over Patient 13: quicker treatment (255min vs 285min) (margin: +0.005, confidence: low)
     5. t=10:15: Patient 18 chosen over Patient 13: close call: same severity (level 5), wait time edge to Patient 13, similar deterioration rates (~0.62), similar treatment times (~255min) (margin: +0.000, confidence: low)
     6. t=13:15: Patient 21 chosen over Patient 22: deteriorating faster (0.63 vs 0.12 rate), longer wait (120min vs 105min) (margin: +0.041, confidence: low)
     7. t=14:30: Patient 25 chosen over Patient 23: deteriorating faster (0.29 vs 0.04 rate) (margin: +0.045, confidence: low)
     8. t=15:00: Patient 23 chosen over Patient 22: close call: same severity (level 5), wait time edge to Patient 22, deterioration edge to Patient 22, treatment speed edge to Patient 23 (margin: +0.042, confidence: low)
     9. t=17:30: Patient 26 chosen over Patient 24: close call: same severity (level 5), wait time edge to Patient 24, similar deterioration rates (~0.11), treatment speed edge to Patient 26 (margin: +0.041, confidence: low)
     10. t=17:45: Patient 24 chosen over Patient 22: close call: same severity (level 5), wait time edge to Patient 22, similar deterioration rates (~0.10), similar treatment times (~240min) (margin: +0.058, confidence: moderate)
     11. t=18:00: Patient 22 chosen over Patient 19: deteriorating faster (0.12 vs 0.04 rate) (margin: +0.078, confidence: moderate)
     12. t=20:30: Patient 28 chosen over Patient 27: quicker treatment (135min vs 180min) (margin: +0.010, confidence: low)
     13. t=21:30: Patient 27 chosen over Patient 19: close call: same severity (level 5), wait time edge to Patient 19, similar deterioration rates (~0.05), similar treatment times (~180min) (margin: +0.270, confidence: high)
     14. t=21:45: Patient 29 chosen over Patient 19: deteriorating faster (0.62 vs 0.04 rate) (margin: +0.528, confidence: high)
     15. t=22:45: Patient 19 chosen over Patient 16: close call: same severity (level 5), wait time edge to Patient 16, deterioration edge to Patient 16, treatment speed edge to Patient 19 (margin: +0.016, confidence: low)
