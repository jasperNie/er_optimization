   ALL TRIAGE DECISIONS:
     1. t=09:30: Patient 6 chosen over Patient 7: deteriorating faster (0.68 vs 0.28 rate), longer wait (30min vs 15min), quicker treatment (225min vs 240min) (margin: +0.229, confidence: high)
     2. t=13:15: Patient 10 chosen over Patient 11: higher severity (level 5 vs 4), longer wait (90min vs 60min) (margin: +0.274, confidence: high)
     3. t=14:15: Patient 12 chosen over Patient 11: close call: same severity (level 5), wait time edge to Patient 11, similar deterioration rates (~0.30), similar treatment times (~255min) (margin: +0.018, confidence: low)
     4. t=14:45: Patient 11 chosen over Patient 9: deteriorating faster (0.28 vs 0.12 rate) (margin: +0.105, confidence: high)
     5. t=16:00: Patient 13 chosen over Patient 9: deteriorating faster (0.65 vs 0.12 rate) (margin: +0.295, confidence: high)
     6. t=18:30: Patient 9 chosen over Patient 14: higher severity (level 5 vs 4), much longer wait (420min vs 195min) (margin: +0.419, confidence: high)
     7. t=19:15: Patient 16 chosen over Patient 15: higher severity (level 5 vs 2), deteriorating faster (0.62 vs 0.30 rate) (margin: +0.681, confidence: high)
     8. t=20:00: Patient 17 chosen over Patient 15: higher severity (level 5 vs 2) (margin: +0.541, confidence: high)
     9. t=22:30: Patient 18 chosen over Patient 14: deteriorating faster (0.28 vs 0.04 rate) (margin: +0.138, confidence: high)
     10. t=23:30: Patient 20 chosen over Patient 14: deteriorating faster (0.28 vs 0.04 rate) (margin: +0.344, confidence: high)
     11. t=23:45: Patient 14 chosen over Patient 15: higher severity (level 5 vs 4), much longer wait (510min vs 315min) (margin: +0.867, confidence: high)
